//TINY USB
//*
Understand Tiny USB's MIC NODE Stack. This is how the authors achived the micnode configuration. (Does the stack of TUD need to be modified?)
PDM is called in usb_microphone executable. Could this be modified to accept the analog microphone instead of the pdm? Would increasing the pdm mic volume
level increase the lower decibel sounds? Would this sound buzzy? At the current moment data_samples are set to 16 bit int. Can this be changed? What would
happen? 
PLAY AROUND WITH THIS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
